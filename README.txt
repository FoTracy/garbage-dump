Git says to add a README file so here you go.

I imagine if this were a project this would be a useful place to explain the functionality of the project.

Unfortunately, this is a garbage dump, so the best you can do with this file is burn it for warmth.
Stay toasty!

Adding some cool stuff. Can you merge my PR?
